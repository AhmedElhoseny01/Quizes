                        <h3>How long before the exit you must be planning it?</h3>
                        <p class="desc">The ideal timing for planning an exit strategy is at
                            least 5â€“10 years beforehand. But unfortunately, that kind of diligent approach is not
                            always applicable. So how does a CEO or an owner can perform a quicker exit?</p>

                        <p class="desc">It's no dotcom-bubble burst today as it was at the verge of the centuries. But
                            still,
                            with so many different trends receiving investment funding,
                            it is wise for a company to file an IPO at this time in the stock's history.</p>

                            financial meltdown.
                            Hiring a new Chief Financial Officer may seem like an obvious managerial solution from that
                            list. But actually,
                            is it the best decision?</p>
